## Chapter 2: Shell Shocked

- Tiny market fluctiations. *market inefficiencies* that become predictable from analysus can bring in millions to the first investor who discovers them. Keep churning profits until phenomenon ends or the resot of the market realized it.

Shaw investments. Fast-paced. Everything powered by math. Most quants abstract math or physics background. 

People's retirement fnds and mortgages. All their gains came from someone elses' loss. 

### Housing crisis

July 2007 "interbank" interest spliked. After recession following 2001 attacks, low interest loans fueled a housing boom. Anyone could get a mortgage - building vast new developments, banks gambled billions on the financial instriments tied to the building boom.

Fising interest rates signaled touble. Banks were losing trust in each other to pay back overnight loans. Coming to grips with dagerous hunk in their own portfolios and judged others were likely sitting on as much risk or more.

Hedge funds don't ride markets up, but predict the movements within them - down could be every bit as lucrative.

robert Rubin's gutting of Glass- Steagall Act allowed banks to originate (fraudulent) loans and sell them to their customers as securities while betting against the very securities they sold their customers.

What if tomorrow didn't resemble yesterday/ All the models based on the past and the assumption that patterns would repeat. 

Bundled mortgages, as a kind of bond, to play regular dividends. Became pilar of capitol market. Divided into tranches, some considered rock-solid others carried more risk - and a higher interest rate.

Banks were making money loaning people money for homes they couldn't afford. Write unsustrainible mortgages, collect the feesm then unload the loan onto the mortgage security markey. Strawberry-picker in Rancho Grande making $14,000 a year financed $720,000 house.

"Emerging markets" "ghetto loans" actively sought out poor and minority victums for predatory loans.

Risk model attached to mortgage-backdd securities - WMD. False assumptions: mathemeticians were crunching the numbers and balancing risk, assumed tht not many peoplke would default at the same time - defaults theorized to be largely random and unrelated events. Led to belief that solid morggages would offset the losers in each tranche. Risk models assumed future would look like th epast.

Banks needed AAA ratings to sell the bonds. THree credit rating agencies. Rating became big business generating big fees. If they rated anything less than AAA, the banks would take their business to their competitors - paid more interest to customer satisfction than to accuracy of models. Pernicious feedback loops. 

AAA ratings on defective products turned into dollars, which created confidence in products rated -- mutual back-scratching and pocket-filling. 

Issue of scale. Modern computing fueled fraud at scale unparalleled in history. Compounded bvy other bast markets that grew up areound MBS - CDO's Collaterized Debt Obligations and credit default swaps. Swaps were small insurance policies that transferred the risk on a bond. Banks and hedges a sense of security - supposedly balanced risk. But if the entities holding the insurance policies go belly up, as many did, the chain reaction blows holes through the global economy

Synthetic CDOs went one step further: contracts whose walue depended on the performance of credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities.

$3T sypprime by 2007. Market around it magnified risk 20-fold. Larger than any national economy.

Only people could sift through the mortgages to figure out what was horseshit and what wasn't. Painstaking because people, unlinke originating algorithms, cna;t scale theit work exponentially -- and that work, at this time, was low prioroty.

Value of the debt and homes kept falling. Owners who could afford mortgages before economic nosedive were now at risk of defaulting too. 

Secondhalf of 2008, disaster hit mainstream - started seeing the people on the other side of the algorithms. Millions of americans losing jons. Credit card defaults, 

Monte Carlo search. 

2011 - rebranded as a Data Scientist - Intent Media

Design an algorithm to defferentiate window shoppers from buyers on travel website. Casual viewers offered ads to competitors and got ad revenue from browsing. 

### Arms Race: Going to College

One WMD issue is scale. A formula - be it a diet or tax code - may be perfectly innovuous in theory. But if it grows to be a national or global standard, it creates its own distorted and dystopian economy. This happened in higher education.

1983 *U.S. News & World Report* decided to evaluate and rank 1,800 colleges and universities. 

In the beginning, scores based entirely on opinion surveys. Hit with readers, but administrators questioned fiarness - look at the *data*.

Start out with series of hunches - not a scientific process and scant grounding in statistical analysis. Just people wondering what matters most, figuring out which variables they can count, and deciding how much weight to give each in a formula.

Most disciplines this type of analysis would demand more rigor - some kind of scoring system rating the model to reality, but "educational excellence" was harder to define, quantify, and nothing to really compare to model. Can't directly measure learning, hapiness, confidence, friendship, or other important aspects.

Picked proxies that seemed to corrolate with success. SAT scores, student-teacher ratios, and acceptance rates. Percentage of freshman to sophomore to graduates. Percentage of living alumni who donated. 3/4 of the rating was from an algorithmy formalizing these opinions in code, remaining quarter factored subjective views from surveys.

1988 was first data-driven ranking. Results seemed sensible. But it became the national stndard and started a vicious feedback loop. Ranking self-reinforcing. If a college fared badly in the eating, its reputation would suffer, and conditions would deterioate. Top students and teachers would avoid it and rankings would tumble further.

Room for varying opinions with good arguments on each side previously with college reputations. Now overshadowed by single column of numbers. College presidents scrambled to boost performance in 15 areas defined by journalists at a secont-tier magazine.

Report quickly became a national standard. Great scale, widespread damage, and spiral of destructive feedback loops. Not as opaque as many other models, but still a WMD.

Baylor pays for students to retake the SAT, schools sent false SAT data to US News, and other factors fudged.

When you create a model from proxies, it is simpler to game the system. Proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent.

Forcing everyone to shoor for the same goals creates a rat race with harmful unintended consequences. 

Financing - tuition and fees - left out of the model. What is the objective of the modeler? Wanted model to show historically top schools on top. If finances were considered, cheaper good schools could have placed highly which could create surprises and dow doubts. Safer to start with venerable champions on top. Presidents had 15 factors to consider, but keepingcosts low wasn't one of them. Raised prices to address others.

1985-2013, cost of higher education rose by over 500%, nearly four times the rate of inflatio. Building booms and increased amenities to attract top students. 

Students trrated like investment portfolios with assets and liabilities. Educational consulting firms rank prospects by geography, gender, ethnicity, field of study, academic standard, etc. All within ecosystem of US News rankings. As rankings grow, so do efforts to game them. Global - Saudi A2rabia King Abdulaziz University math department jumed to 7th place in 2 years beeating Cambridge and MIT. School offered highlycited mathemeticians $72k to serve as adjunct faculty. Flew business class and five star hotel couple weeks a year. Change affiliation on THomson Reuters citation website - claiming citations of adjunct faculty and significantly boosting ratings.

Coaches and tutors and test-prep industry. Top-Tier admissions four day "application boot camp" costs $16,000 plus room and board. Develop essays, interview coaching, and other prep. With future success hinging on elite university - people pay the price.

Victims are the vast majority of Americans - poor and middle class who don;t have thousands of dollars to spend on courses and consultants. Miss out on key insider knowledge. Result is an education system that favors the privliged. Tilts against needy stdents and deepens the social divide.

Obama proposed new college ranking model, more in tune with national priorities and middle-class means. Sap power from for-profit education institutions. Use different metrics: affordability, percentage of poor and minority suudents, and postgraduate job placement, graduation rate. If college failed to meet standards, cut off from $180B/year federal student loan market (which for-profit universities have been feasting on).

Seem like worthy goals, but every ranking system ca be gamed. Different feedback loops with unintinded consequences.

Easy to raise graduation rates by lowering standards. Income of graduates can be boosted by eliminating training programs in lower paid jobs - teachers, social workers, etc.

Lower costs by reducing percentage of tenured faculty replacing expensive proessors with cheaper instructors or adjuncts.

Graduates employed after nine months gamed - some schools hired own graduates for hourly temp jobs to count as employed.

## Chapter 4. Propaganda Machine: Online Advertising

People leave rvers of data giving advertisers the ability to learn about them in grat detail. Which, in turn enables companies to target them with valuable information at just the right time and place.

Justification? Argues personalized advertising would be useful and timely that customers would welcome it. Thoughts were that people objected to ads because they were irrelavent. 

For-profit colleges, University of Phoneix targeted poor people with the bait of upward mobility. Multimillion-dollar operations underwritten by government-financed loans and the diplomas offered had scant value in the workplace. 

## Chapter 5 Civilian Casualties: Justice in the Age of Big Data

Lots of predictive crime algorithms that shape patrol and enforcement patterns. Can increase efficiency of budget-strapped police forces. Generates "hot-spots" based on past trends, increased presence in these areas lowers some crime rates. Siminar to baseball defense-shifting models. Increased presence results in increased enforcement of lower-teir nonviolent, nuisance crimes. More reports - more crime - more cops in same areas - more reports - feedback cycle filling prisons with hundreds of thousands of people found guilty of victimless crimes. Many poorer neighborhoods - predominately blacks and hispanics. So, even if models are race-bline, the results are not.

Petty crimes have been linked to more serious ones since 1982 - George Kelling article on "broken windows polcing: concept where lower level crimes create an atmosphere of disorder, scaring away law-abiding citizens, and becoming breeding grounds for serious crimes. 90's zero-tolerance campaigns, famously in NYC. Gained broad support - millions of young minority men sent to prion, many for minor offenses.

Most jurisdictions a crime map of petty crime tracks powerty - reinforcing society's conceptions that poor are responsible for shortcomings and commit most of the crime. 

Financial crimes - low priority. Wealth and lobbies lead to underpolicing. If zero-tolerance enforves. Choices made on where to focus attention. Criminalized poverty nelieving tools used are scientific and fair.

Data "hackathon" bringing together hackers, nerds, mathematicians, and software geeks to look at stop and frisk. Bloomerg raised 600% - 700,000 spot checks. Majority of those stopped were innocent. 85% of stops were of yound aftican american or latino men. Many stopped repeatedly. 0.1% linked to violent ctime. Drug posession, underaged drinking prosecuted. Determined to be unconstitutional. 

WMDs often faced with choice between fairness and efficacy. Legal traditions lean towards fairness. Constitution presumes innocence and engineered to value it. WMDs favor efficiency. Fairness is hard to quantify. Are we willing to sacrifice a bit of efficiency for fairness? Handicap models leaving certain data out? Justice should be something one part of society inflicts upon the other. 

Recidivism study in Harris country. 2.6M recods. Longer inmate spent locked up, greater chance they would be unemployed upon release, require food stamps and public assistance, commit further crimes.

Facial recognition emerging for broader surveilance. Shifting to identifying potential lawvreakers problematic. 

## 6 Ineligible to Serve: Getting a Job

Personality tests from Kronos - five factor model: extraversion, agreeableness, conscitntiousness, neuroticism, and openness to ideas. Vanderbilt student unable to get minimum-wage grocery jobs based on thest and model. Widespread among large corporations. 1970s MIT Kronos software tools Workforce Ready PR. Automation of hiring process $500 M industry growing 10-15% annually. Used on 60-70% pf prospective workers, up from just 30-40% five years ago.

Can't incorporate information aabout how candidate would actually perform at the company. Settle for proxies. 1971 *Griggs v Duke* daid IQ tests for jobs were discriminatory and therefore illegal. Independent of legaliity, these tests are poor predictors of jon performance. Illegal screens for mental illness. Process is opaque. 

2001-2 before resume ATS, MI sent 5k phone resumes modeled for race. White names 50% more callbacks. ORchestras started having blind auditions in the 70s - women players increasef five-fold.

72% resumes never seen by human eyes. Programs flip through them and score for job opening. Must sprinkle with key words specific job is looking for. resunate.com

## 7 Sweating Bullets: On the Job

New corporate term: *clopening* Emplpyee works late to close then opens a few hours later on the next day. Can make logistical sense for the corporation, but shitty for the worker.  Wildly irregular schedules are increasingly common, particularly for low-wage workers. Lack of scheduling notice compounds the problem. Havoc for lives and child care.

These irregular scheles are a product of the data economy. Efficiency-promoting algorithms treat workers as cogs in the machine. 

Scheduling used to be unscientific. Now trends in customer traffic patterns dictate staffing. Goal is to spend as little as possible, which means minimum staff to deal with changing customer traffic. Money saved comes straight from employees' pockets. Old ways - predictible schedule with periods of downtime. Now, every minute should be busy. 

2/3 of food service workers and 1/2 of retail find out about schedules with a notive of a week or less - often just a day or two. 

Despite pledges to improve, the problem continues. Manageer pau is contingent upon staff efficieincy measured as revenue per employee per hour. 

"Operations Research" or OR is a discipline of mathematics driving these operations. Help farmers plant crops or civil engineers to plan highways. Took off in WWII. Afer, corporations poured enourmous resources in to OR. Science of logistics radically transformed how goods are produced and brought to market.

60's Japanese auto manufacturers devised "Just in Time" practices. Instead of having mountains of inventory, things arrived as needed - complex supply chains. Serves as the mathematical underpinnings of Amazon, FedEx, UPS, etc.

Scheduling extention of JIT mentalitiy, but instread of laenmower blades or cell phone screens, it is moving people. People who badly need money and have to accept the shitty schedules.

Churn and turnover affects bottom line of companies, but the issue from a worker perspective is an oversupply of low-wage labor. This oversupplyw with scarcity of effective unions, leaves workers with no bargaining power. So, more absurd schedules are produced with limited churn. Make more money while employees' lives get more hellish. So pervasive, worker knows changing jobs is unlikely to improve situation - close to captive workforce.

Scheduling software huge WMD taking advantage of those already struggling to make ends meet. Poisonous feedback loop. Haphazard schedule makes it next to impossible to persue education and escape the oversupplied poool of low-wage labor. Anxiety and sleep deprivation while algorithm keeps them under 30 hours per week so healthcare isn't provided. Also makes it next to impossible to have second job, also with shitty short-notice scheduling.

Challenging schedule rolls down to childrens' routines impacting cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Root of the problem stems from modelers' choice of objectives: optimized for efficiency and prifitibility while neglecting justice or the good of the "team".

Need press, regulation, stong unions, and politicians willing to restrain corporations' worst excesses.

Declining SAT scores... Artifiact of education becoming more accessible to minorities and low-wage students historically excluded. Even though the composite averages were declining, when population was broken down into income groups - scores of every single group were rising.

**Simpson's Paradox** Whole body of data displays one trend, yet when the data is subdivided, the opposite trend emerges for the subgroups.

    - Toxic and ubiquitous
- Nearly half of employers screen by credit score
    - Creates dangerous poverty cycle
    - Spiraling feedback loop
    - Framing debt as a moral issue is a mistake

### Late nineteenth century - Frederick Hoffman - Prudential Life Insurance
- Created potent WMD
- Likely intended no harm
- Valuable malaria work

    - NY: Credit from 'excellent' to good, raises price $225
    - FL: Clean driving record and poor credit score pays 1552 more a ywar than drivers with excellent credit and a *drunk driving conviction*
- Pricing tiers vary from 90% discounts to 800% of the average - unteathered from risk-based premiums
- Unfair and opaque
- Poor drivers who can least afford outrageous premiums are squeezed
- Sense networks - anonymous movement tracking through cell phone data
    - Machine learning segmentation
- Oceans of behavioral data being fed into artificial intelligence
    - Will determine how we are threated by other machines
    - Ads / prices / etc

### Health insurance

- 1943 - IRS modified tac code granting tax-free status to employer-based health insurance
    - Only 9% of Americans had private insurance as a job benefit
    - New tax perk, businesses started competing for employees by offering insurance
    - Within ten years, 65% of americans

    - Easy formula to gauge obesity in large population
    - Called the 'average man'
    - Useful concept, but not when applied to an individual

    - Economic sticks and carrots tied to BMI are flawed

## 10. The Targeted Citizen: Civic Life

- Facebook - once you upload something it is theirs and their algorithms decide which of your friends see it and when
- Immensely powerful network of 1.5 B people also a publicly traded company
- May feel like a town square, but facebook determines what we see and learn based on thier own interest
- About 2/3 American adults have profiles
    - Average 39 min per day, almost as much as face-to-face socializing
    - Nearly half users report that they count on facebook for news
- Voter megaphone; able to impact political process worldwide
    - Harvest infomation

- Target with advertisements
- A / B testing
- Thousands of tests and tweaks
- Evaluating gpeople as potential voters, volunteers, or donors
- Also reflected stances on issues
- Data Collection- Cambridge Analytica paid academics for access to facebook research datasets

    - Openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism
    - Cruz: targeted ads for each segments ran on shows likely to watch
- Value of a voter in swing state higher than one already 'gone' and these values are dynamic 

### Civic impact beyond elections
- Lobbyists and interest roots are using targeted advertising to spur "grassroots" support
    - Legislative pressure, donations, etc.
- Deceptive and no accountability
- Pinpoint vulnerable populations with fear-mongering, while simultaneously shielding voters who would be repulsed or outraged from seeing the same ads
- TV advertising used to be broad and accountable
    - Breaking users into behavioral buckets for micro-targeting
- Becoming harder to access the political messages our neighbors are hearing
     - Everyone being presented with what is thought they want to see and hear
    - Makes it harder to understand where people are coming from, driving polarization

- Only voters that *matter* are in a handful of counties in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and a few other places
    - Undemocratic
    - Voters that *don't matter* are neglected and ignored and more likely to become disinterested creating a nefarious feedback loop
    - Looking for cheapest vote to buy - undevided votter vs non-voter; prods certain segment to stay active and let the rest lie fallow

- Same models currently used to inflict damage could be used to humanitiy's benefit
    - Instead of targeting to manipulate, could line up people for help
    - Ad can rile up people angry about high rent, but same technology could be used to identify those who would most benefit from affordable housing and help them find it
- Problem is the goals and objectives
    - Change the objective from leeching off people to helping and WMD is disarmed and can become a force for good

## Conclusion

- Every aspect of our lives - school, college, court, workplace, and voting booth - impacted by WMDs
- Promising efficiency and fairness they:
    - Distort higher education
    - Drive up debt
    - Spur mass incarceration
    - Pummel the ppor at nearly every juncture
    - Undermine democracy
### Being poor in a world of WMDs is getting more and more dangerous and expensive
- Poor people likely to have poor credit and live in high-crime areas surrounded by other poor people
- Showered with predatory adds - subprime loans and for-profit schools
- Increased policing, arrests, and harsher sentancing
- Data feeds into other algoritms
- Block from jobs
- Increase rates for mortgages, car, loans, and insuranCE
- Further drives down credit and spirals
   
- Societies "winners" are showered with good things and keeps them from observing how the same models are destroying lives, sometimes only blocks away

### Oath for Data Scientists
- I will remember that I didn't make the world and it doesn't satisfy my equations
- Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I wil not be overly impressed nby mathematics
- I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so
- Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights
- I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension

- Good principles, but solid values and self-regulation only rein in the scrupulous
- On-the-ground pressure for specific answers
-
