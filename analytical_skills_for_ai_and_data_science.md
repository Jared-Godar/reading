### Analytical Thinking and the AI-Driven Enterprise

### What is AI?

- Four levels of understanding
    1. Never heard the term. Pretty small group as the term permeates movies, TV, etc
    2. Believe it is closer to what practitioners term *Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)* or human-like intelligence. Most people fall into this category. Humanoid-like machines that can complete tasks and make decisions like humans.
    3. Practitioners. Dislike the term and prefer the machine learning (ML) label to describe what they do. Making accurate predictions using powerful algorithms and vast amounts of data. Darling is Deep Learning - or learning through deep neural networks. Only a few years ago image recognition and natural language processing were beyond the scope of computer tasks. Practitioners think ML when they hear AI and, to them, it means predictive algorithm.
    4. "The Experts." Doing research and advancing the field of AI. 

### Current AI

- Trouble comes with the name as it makes us think of human-;ole intelligence.
- Hype about "AI disruption" - those advocating for it without understanding what it does (and doesn't). Can still add substantial value.
- 7 of 10 top global companies by market capitalization are in the technology secton and embrace data and AI-revolution.


### The Data Revolution

- Before AI, **Big Data** was the main tech headline.
- 2004, Google MapReduce - distributed computing. Start of data revolution.
- More, diverse, and quickly accessible data.
- Then came predictive algorithms and data-driven culture.

**Three Vs:**

- *volume*
- *variety*
- *velocity*

- 2018 estimate: 90% of data created in the history of humankind had been generated in the previous two years.
- Store and process larger amounts of data
- Deal with unstructured data
  - Text
  - Images
  - Videos

- Old: Enterprise Data Warehouse - used to store and analyze structured data
- New: *DataLake* provides flexibility and computational power


### Data maturity Models

- **Descriptive** More and better data provides more granular view of performance
- **Predictive** Often too late when react - replace raeaction with predictive action. Recommenders, selling right product to right person at right time.
- **Prescriptive** Automate and design intelligent systems. Once you have enough predictive power, you can find the best actions for your business objectives. Move from prediction to optimization. 

### Analytical Skills for the modern AI-Driven Enterprise

- *Data-drivenness* Analytical thinking. "we mean the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and the fact-based management to drive decisions and actions."
- "Analytical skills are, simply put, problem-solving skills. They are characteristics and abilities that allow you to approach problems in a logical, rational manner in an effort to sort out the best solution."
- Here - ability to translate business problems into *prescriptive solutions*. Business *problems* equated with business *decisions*. Creating value through analytical decision-making. AI will address uncertainty.

## Chapter 2: Intro to Analytical Thinking

- Crucial Skill: Formulate the right business question. (Only care about business questions that entail business decisions.)
- Dissect decisions
  - levers
  - consequences
  - business results

### Power of Predictive Analysis

- Cancer Detection.
- X-ray, CT, etc: description of current status
- AI remarkable prowess of predicting lung cancer from CT scans
- Doctors then recommend the right course of action. AI leverages prediction, but humans prescribe

- Churn
- Descriptive patterns - acceleration, seasonal patterms, positive correlation between churn rate and household income
- Correlation != causation
  - Root cause analysis
- Predicting Churn: Aggregate rates? Or specific customers at risk - change retention strategies.
- Prescriptive: reccomend course of action to reduce the rate of churn
- Cost-benefit analysis maximizing customer lifetime value
  - Current value of a customer short-sighted, need long view
  - Customers as assets - stream of profits. Customer may change companies at any time - so need uncertainty in time window
