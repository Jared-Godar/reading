### Life after Codeup

- You **are** a Data Scientist
  - Refer to yourself in that way
  - You become a data scientist when you can do a data science
  - Don't sell yourself short
  - Language you use to talk to each other now is completely different than it was six months ago
  - Now using the vocabulary of a practitioner of that skill
- Imposter syndrome
  - Still going to kick in during interviews and early job stages
  - Remember framewords to overcome
    - Acknowledge it when it happens
    - Go to the interviews even if you are scared
    - Stick with it even if it feels like it is going bad

### Now that I have graduated, what should I do?

- Lots of keyboard time
- **5 Hours:** every day practicing craft
  - scrape
    - python
    - models
    - viz
- **1 Hour:** Learning something new
- **2 Hours:** Job search

Already basically doing this schedule in class. Keep it going now that class is done.

Bad code from learning something new makes employer excited about the fact that you are learning new things

"It's kind of fun to do the impossible." - Walt Disney

What we are doing every day was considered impossible not that long ago. What we are about to do in this field, many think is impossible now, but we will be doing it!
