# The Visual Display of Wuantitative Information
## Edward R. Tufte

**Second Edition, 2001**

### Intro

Book begain in 1975 when Princeton asked Tufte to teach statistics to a dozen journalists visiting to learn economoics. Annotated a collection of readings, with a long section on statistical graphics. Scant literature at the time and most ly concerning "graphic standards" not best practices of qantiatiative reasoning and visual evidence. 

>Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.

Use of abstract, non-representational pictures to show nubers is a surprisingly recent invention. Not intil 1750-1800 that statistical graphics - length and area for quantity, time series, scatterplots, and multivariate displays - were invented. (After logarithms, cartesian coordinates, calculus, and basics of probability theory)

**William Playfair (1759-1823)** developed or improved nearly all the fundaental graphical designs of his "linear arithmetic."

At their best, graphics are instruments for reasoning about quantitative information. Of all the methods for analyzing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data fraphics are usually the simplest and most powerful.

First part of book - examples. Second part - language for discussing graphics and practical theory of data graphics. 

Concerned with how to communication through the simultaneous presentation of words, numbers, and pictures. 

Annually 900 Billion - 2 Trillion images of statistical graphics are printed. 

# I. Graphical Practice

## 1. Graphical Excellence

Ability to present complesx ideas with clarity, precision, and efficiency:
- Show the data
- Induce the viewer to think about the substance, **NOT**
    - Methodology
    - Graphic Design

**Anscombe's quartet** All have same linear model, but quite different.

Statistical graphics, like statistical calculations, only as good as what goes into them. Shitty model and data can't be rescued by graphics, no matter how clever or fancy. 

Silly theory = silly graphic

### Data Maps

Age-adjusted rates of various cancers by county (3,056 in US)

Can be thought of in many different ways at many different levels of analysis: overall patterns, or fine county-by-county detail. 

Facilitate easy analysis, but have flaws: conflate visual importance of each county with visual area erather than population (or number of cancer deaths). Visual impression of datea entangled with the circumstances of geographic boundaries, shapes, and aread -- chronic problem of shade-in, "blot" or "patch" maps.

Also, data source: death certiciates cause of death. Indluence of diagnostic fashions dictated by plae and time -- troucling adulterant of ecidence. Some visual clusters my reflect diagnostic customs or fads along with the actual differences in cancer rates.

Data maps have a curious history. Not until 17th centyru that cartographical and statistical standards advanced to the point where a data map was created. Fully 5,000 years after the first geographical maps appeared on clay tablets.
